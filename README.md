Getting Started

I am a marketeer, web developer and designer and enjoys being creative and have a keen interest in technology, and is fascinated by both new hardware and software. I also likes retro technology, classic cars and in my spare time enjoys traveling. I am immersed in the world of Java, PDF and HTML5 but loves to explore other areas in the world of tech.
